XXX-Redacted/PERSON And Anr vs State Of Rajasthan And Anr on XXX-Redacted/DATE
Thus, tXXX-Redacted/Gender question that falls for consideration before us is as to wXXX-Redacted/GendertXXX-Redacted/Genderr tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Sessions was empowered to take cognizance of offence under Sections 304-B and 498-A of IPC, wXXX-Redacted/Gendern similar application to tXXX-Redacted/Gender effect was rejected by tXXX-Redacted/Gender JMFC while committing tXXX-Redacted/Gender case to XXX-Redacted/PERSON, taking cognizance of offence only under Section 306 IPC and specifically refusing to take cognizance of offence under Sections 304-B and 498-A IPC. Mr. XXX-Redacted/PERSON, learned senior counsel appearing for tXXX-Redacted/Gender appellants, submitted that wXXX-Redacted/Gendern tXXX-Redacted/Gender case is triable by tXXX-Redacted/Gender XXX-Redacted/PERSON, Judicial Magistrate after completing tXXX-Redacted/Gender committal proceedings can commit tXXX-Redacted/Gender case for trial before tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Sessions. He can do so by simply committing tXXX-Redacted/Gender case on finding from tXXX-Redacted/Gender Police report that tXXX-Redacted/Gender case was triable by tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Sessions. In tXXX-Redacted/Gender alternative, XXX-Redacted/Gender can take cognizance of offence on tXXX-Redacted/Gender basis of Police report and tXXX-Redacted/Gendern commit tXXX-Redacted/Gender case for trial to tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Sessions. WXXX-Redacted/Gendern tXXX-Redacted/Gender Judicial Magistrate adopts tXXX-Redacted/Gender former approach by not taking tXXX-Redacted/Gender cognizance of offence under Section 190 of tXXX-Redacted/Gender Code and commits tXXX-Redacted/Gender case for trial before tXXX-Redacted/Gender XXX-Redacted/PERSON, XXX-Redacted/PERSON is competent to exercise its power under Section 193 of tXXX-Redacted/Gender Code and to take cognizance of offence in tXXX-Redacted/Gender light of judgment of tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court in XXX-Redacted/PERSON case. However, if tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate adopts alternate course of action, namely, takes cognizance of tXXX-Redacted/Gender offence and tXXX-Redacted/Gendern commits tXXX-Redacted/Gender case to tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Sessions, XXX-Redacted/PERSON has no power to take fresh cognizance of tXXX-Redacted/Gender offence inasmuch as cognizance of offence can be taken only once. Again, in support of tXXX-Redacted/Gender proposition, aid of tXXX-Redacted/Gender judgment in XXX-Redacted/PERSON case is taken.

“7.1 Does tXXX-Redacted/Gender Committing Magistrate have any otXXX-Redacted/Genderr role to play after committing tXXX-Redacted/Gender case to tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Session on finding from tXXX-Redacted/Gender police report that tXXX-Redacted/Gender case was triable by tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Session?

7.2 If tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate disagrees with tXXX-Redacted/Gender police report and is convinced that a case had also been made out for trial against tXXX-Redacted/Gender persons who had been placed in column 2 of tXXX-Redacted/Gender report, does XXX-Redacted/Gender have tXXX-Redacted/Gender jurisdiction to issue summons against tXXX-Redacted/Genderm also in order to include tXXX-Redacted/Genderir names, along with Nafe Singh, to stand trial in connection with tXXX-Redacted/Gender case made out in tXXX-Redacted/Gender police report?

(c) Cognizance of an offence can only be taken once. In tXXX-Redacted/Gender event, a Magistrate takes cognizance of tXXX-Redacted/Gender offence and tXXX-Redacted/Gendern commits tXXX-Redacted/Gender case to tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Session, tXXX-Redacted/Gender question of taking fresh cognizance of tXXX-Redacted/Gender offence and, tXXX-Redacted/Genderreafter, proceeding to issue summons, is not in accordance with law. If cognizance is to be taken of tXXX-Redacted/Gender offence, it could be taken eitXXX-Redacted/Genderr by tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate or by tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Session. TXXX-Redacted/Gender language of Section 193 of tXXX-Redacted/Gender Code very clearly indicates that once tXXX-Redacted/Gender case is committed to tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Session by tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate, tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Session assumes original jurisdiction and all that goes with tXXX-Redacted/Gender assumption of such jurisdiction. TXXX-Redacted/Gender provisions of Section 209 of tXXX-Redacted/Gender Code will, tXXX-Redacted/Genderrefore, have to be understood as tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate playing a passive role in committing tXXX-Redacted/Gender case to tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Session on finding from tXXX-Redacted/Gender police report that tXXX-Redacted/Gender case was triable by tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Session. Nor can tXXX-Redacted/Genderre be any question of part cognizance being taken by tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate and part cognizance being taken by tXXX-Redacted/Gender Sessions Judge.

19. TXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate, in exercise of its power under Section 190 CrPC, can refuse to take cognizance if tXXX-Redacted/Gender material on record warrants so. TXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate must, in such a case, be satisfied that tXXX-Redacted/Gender complaint, case diary, statements of tXXX-Redacted/Gender witnesses recorded under Sections 161 and 164 CrPC, if any, do not make out any offence. At tXXX-Redacted/Gender stage, tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate performs a judicial function. However, XXX-Redacted/Gender cannot appreciate tXXX-Redacted/Gender evidence on record and reach a conclusion as to which evidence is acceptable, or can be relied upon. Thus, at tXXX-Redacted/Gender stage appreciation of evidence is impermissible. TXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate is not competent to weigh tXXX-Redacted/Gender evidence and tXXX-Redacted/Gender balance of probability in tXXX-Redacted/Gender case.” Keeping in view tXXX-Redacted/Gender aforesaid legal position, we may now discuss tXXX-Redacted/Gender circumstances under which tXXX-Redacted/Gender cognizance was taken by tXXX-Redacted/Gender Session Judge. Here is a case wXXX-Redacted/Genderre tXXX-Redacted/Gender Police report which was submitted to tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate, tXXX-Redacted/Gender IO had not included tXXX-Redacted/Gender appellants as accused persons. TXXX-Redacted/Gender complainant had filed application before tXXX-Redacted/Gender learned Magistrate with prayer to take cognizance against tXXX-Redacted/Gender appellants as well. TXXX-Redacted/Gender application was duly considered and rejected by tXXX-Redacted/Gender learned Magistrate. TXXX-Redacted/Gender situation in tXXX-Redacted/Gender case is, thus, not wXXX-Redacted/Genderre tXXX-Redacted/Gender investigation report/chargesXXX-Redacted/Genderet filed under Section 173(8) of tXXX-Redacted/Gender Code implicated tXXX-Redacted/Gender appellants and appellants contended that tXXX-Redacted/Gendery are wrongly implicated. On tXXX-Redacted/Gender contrary, tXXX-Redacted/Gender Police itself had mentioned in its final report that case against tXXX-Redacted/Gender appellants had not been made out. TXXX-Redacted/Gender was objected to by tXXX-Redacted/Gender complainant who wanted tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate to summon tXXX-Redacted/Genderse appellants as well and for tXXX-Redacted/Gender purpose tXXX-Redacted/Gender application was filed by tXXX-Redacted/Gender complainant under Section 190 of tXXX-Redacted/Gender Code. TXXX-Redacted/Gender appellants had replied to tXXX-Redacted/Gender said application and after XXX-Redacted/Genderaring tXXX-Redacted/Gender arguments, tXXX-Redacted/Gender application was rejected by tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate. TXXX-Redacted/Gender shows that order of tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate was passed with due application of mind wXXX-Redacted/Genderreby XXX-Redacted/Gender refused to take cognizance of tXXX-Redacted/Gender alleged offence against tXXX-Redacted/Gender appellants and confined it only to tXXX-Redacted/Gender son of tXXX-Redacted/Gender appellants. TXXX-Redacted/Gender order was not challenged. Normally, in such a case, it cannot be said that tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate had played 'passive role' while committing tXXX-Redacted/Gender case to tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Sessions. He had, thus, taken cognizance after due application of mind and playing an “active role” in tXXX-Redacted/Gender process. TXXX-Redacted/Gender position would have been different if tXXX-Redacted/Gender Magistrate had simply forwarded tXXX-Redacted/Gender application of tXXX-Redacted/Gender complainant to tXXX-Redacted/Gender Court of Sessions while committing tXXX-Redacted/Gender case. In tXXX-Redacted/Gender scenario, we are of tXXX-Redacted/Gender opinion that it would be a case wXXX-Redacted/Genderre Magistrate had taken tXXX-Redacted/Gender cognizance of tXXX-Redacted/Gender offence. Notwithstanding tXXX-Redacted/Gender same, tXXX-Redacted/Gender XXX-Redacted/PERSON on tXXX-Redacted/Gender similar application made by tXXX-Redacted/Gender complainant before it, took cognizance tXXX-Redacted/Genderreupon. Normally, such a course of action would not be permissible.
