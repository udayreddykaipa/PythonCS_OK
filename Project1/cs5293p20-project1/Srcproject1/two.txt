SEPTEMBER 19--Here's the Las Vegas police report detailing O.J. Simpson's alleged armed robbery of two memorabilia dealers. 
The document provides a comprehensive account of the probe of the September 13 incident in a room at the Palace Station hotel, 
and includes details of interviews with Simpson, businessmen Alfred Beardsley and Bruce Fromong, and Thomas Riccio, the ex-con who helped orchestrate Simpson's bid to recover what he claims were stolen items.
 The report, which notes that Simpson was 'extremely welcoming' to detectives when they met with him at the Palms hotel, quotes the athlete calling Beardsley 'certifiable.' Referring to the dealers's attempts to sell his belongings, Simpson said, 'They sneakin'.' Denying that he was involved in an armed robbery, Simpson said that he went to the hotel to recover 'family stuff.' 'My All American ball!,' he said. 'I would never give that away!' As Simpson was being transported by detectives following his arrest,
 he noted that he came to Las Vegas and 'look what happened, I got arrested.'
